and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard of it all the nations that were about us were afraid and were much cast down in their own eyes and they <unk> that this work was wrought by our god
he that <unk> him will i make a <unk> in the temple of my god and he shall go no more at all out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god the new jerusalem which comes down out of heaven from my god and my new name

which also we speak not in words <unk> by <unk> wisdom but in those <unk> by the spirit <unk> <unk> by <unk>
thus saith jehovah of hosts the god of israel unto all the captivity whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem unto babylon

and <unk> went into jacob s tent and into <unk> s tent and into the two <unk> tents and found nothing and he went out of <unk> s tent and entered into <unk> s tent
know therefore that jehovah thy god doth not give thee this good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a <unk> people
but when they had rest they did evil again before thee and thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies and they had <unk> over them and again they cried unto thee and thou <unk> from the heavens and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy <unk>
but i say unto you that every <unk> word which men shall say they shall <unk> an account of it in <unk>
and david answered and said behold the king s <unk> and let one of the young men come over and <unk> it

a nation of <unk> <unk> which <unk> not the <unk> of the old nor is <unk> to the young
the eyes of jehovah are upon the righteous and his ears are toward their cry

and seeing from afar off a <unk> which had <unk> he came if <unk> he might find <unk> on it and having come up to it he found nothing but <unk> for it was not the time of <unk>
so the king hearkened not to the people for it was brought about by god that jehovah might give <unk> to his word which he spoke through <unk> the <unk> to jeroboam the son of <unk>
ye shall not do so unto jehovah your god

and i myself will smite my hands together and i will <unk> my fury i jehovah have spoken
the face of a man was toward the <unk> on the one side and the face of a young lion toward the <unk> on the other side was it made upon all the house round about

<unk> o sword against my <unk> even against the man that is my <unk> saith jehovah of hosts smite the <unk> and the sheep shall be scattered and i will turn my hand upon the little ones
but <unk> forth <unk> and <unk> it is found <unk> and <unk> to a curse whose end to be burned
are not these the words that jehovah cried by the <unk> prophets when jerusalem was <unk> and at peace and her cities round about her when the south and the <unk> were <unk>
and the days of <unk> after he had <unk> <unk> were <unk> hundred years and he begot sons and daughters
and it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of jehovah had come up out of the midst of the jordan the <unk> of the priests feet were lifted up on to the dry land that the waters of the jordan returned to their place and they <unk> as <unk> over all its <unk>
and they came in and <unk> it but they hearkened not unto thy voice neither walked in thy law they have done nothing of all that thou <unk> them to do so that thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them
and she fell down immediately at his feet and <unk> and when the young men came in they found her dead and having carried her out they buried her by her husband
but from among the crowd they put forward <unk> the jews <unk> him forward and <unk> <unk> with his hand would have made a <unk> to the people
and they came to balaam and said to him thus says <unk> the son of <unk> suffer not thyself i pray thee to be <unk> from coming to me
and <unk> said as jehovah of hosts <unk> before whom i stand surely were it not that i <unk> the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee
and they came with <unk> and found both <unk> and joseph and the <unk> lying in the <unk>
but it is right to be <unk> at all times in what is right and not only when i am present with you
the children of those that had been carried away who had come out of the captivity <unk> burntofferings to the god of israel twelve <unk> for all israel <unk> rams <unk> lambs twelve <unk> for a sinoffering all for a burntoffering to jehovah
and the soul that <unk> unto <unk> and unto <unk> to go a <unk> after them i will set my face against that soul and will cut him off from among his people
and the sons of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and canaan
and <unk> the son of <unk> spoke to <unk> in <unk> <unk> saying let me go i pray thee and i will smite <unk> the son of <unk> and no man shall know it why should he take thy life and all they of judah who are gathered unto thee be scattered and the remnant of judah perish
that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground which thou shalt bring of thy land which jehovah thy god giveth thee and shalt put it in a <unk> and shalt go unto the place that jehovah thy god will <unk> to cause his name to dwell there
and hezekiah hearkened to them and <unk> them all his <unk> the silver and the gold and the <unk> and the fine oil and all the house of his <unk> and all that was found among his <unk> there was nothing in his house nor in all his <unk> that hezekiah did not shew them
and their forty bases of silver two bases under one <unk> and two bases under another <unk>
and a <unk> of the philistines went out to the <unk> of <unk>
and whatever the unclean <unk> <unk> shall be unclean and the soul that <unk> it shall be unclean until even
and <unk> said to the angel of jehovah i pray thee let us <unk> thee and we will make ready a <unk> of the goats for thee
then both the men between whom the <unk> is shall stand before jehovah before the priests and the <unk> that shall be in those days
therefore ye shall have night without a vision and it shall be <unk> unto you without <unk> and the sun shall go down upon the prophets and the day shall be <unk> over them
then jacob was greatly afraid and was <unk> and he <unk> the people that were with him and the sheep and the cattle and the <unk> into two <unk>
and when saul saw the camp of the philistines he was afraid and his heart greatly <unk>
and <unk> the son of <unk> the son of <unk> the son of levi made <unk> and with him <unk> and <unk> the sons of <unk> and on the son of <unk> the sons of reuben
a <unk> <unk> the evil and <unk> himself but the <unk> pass on and are <unk>
and it came to pass that after they had carried it about the hand of jehovah was against the city with very great <unk> and he smote the men of the city both small and great and <unk> broke out upon them
and i will <unk> thee among the nations and <unk> thee through the <unk> and will <unk> thy <unk> out of thee
among the gods there is none like unto thee lord and there is nothing like unto thy works
the lion is come up from his <unk> the <unk> of the nations is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate thy cities shall be laid waste without <unk>
speak unto all the assembly of israel saying on the tenth of this month let them take themselves each a lamb for a father s house a lamb for a house
and out of the <unk> came forth <unk> on the earth and power was given to them as the <unk> of the earth have power
make an end in wrath make an end that they may be no more that they may know that god <unk> in jacob unto the <unk> of the earth selah
and these are the <unk> <unk> which the philistines returned as a <unk> to jehovah for <unk> one for <unk> one for <unk> one for <unk> one for <unk> one
and moses and aaron did all these <unk> before pharaoh but jehovah made pharaoh s heart <unk> and he did not let the children of israel go out of his land
to the end that i may make it <unk> as i <unk> to speak
who <unk> for the <unk> his food when his young ones cry unto god they <unk> for <unk> of <unk>
but he that had received the one went and <unk> in the earth and hid the money of his lord
what is the <unk> that we should serve him and what are we <unk> if we pray unto him
but jesus answering said to her <unk> <unk> thou art <unk> and <unk> about many things
so that all who fell that day of benjamin were <unk> thousand men that drew the sword all these men of <unk>
coming to me and standing by me said to me brother saul receive thy sight and i in the same hour received my sight and saw him
i am jehovah your god who brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am jehovah your god
then said the woman whom shall i bring up to thee and he said bring me up samuel
and she arose and went away and she laid by her <unk> from her and put on the garments of her <unk>
for in the multitude of <unk> are <unk> so with many words but fear god
thus the christ also having been <unk> offered to bear the sins of many shall <unk> to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation
but ye do not believe for ye are not of my sheep as i told you
and thou shalt say unto them every one of the house of israel and of the strangers who <unk> among them that <unk> up a burntoffering or sacrifice
but to him that is able to do far <unk> above all which we ask or <unk> according to the power which works in us
for thou hast been my help and in the <unk> of thy wings will i sing for joy
now i praise you that in all things ye are <unk> of me and that as i have <unk> you ye keep the <unk>
and the seven years of the <unk> began to come according as joseph had said and there was <unk> in all <unk> but in all the land of egypt there was bread
and <unk> the son of <unk> made a <unk> against <unk> the son of <unk> and smote him and slew him and he reigned in his stead in the <unk> year of <unk> the son of <unk>
behold your house is left unto you and i say unto you that ye shall not see me until it come that ye say blessed he that comes in the name of lord
he shall build a house unto my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will <unk> the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever
and i will set up one <unk> over them and he shall feed them even my servant david he shall feed them and he shall be their <unk>
and these shall stand upon mount <unk> to curse reuben gad and <unk> and <unk> dan and <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
for jehovah of hosts that <unk> thee hath <unk> evil against thee for the evil of the house of israel and of the house of judah which they have done for themselves to <unk> me to anger in burning incense unto baal
but this he said <unk> by what death he was about to die
he turned about to the west side <unk> five hundred <unk> with the <unk>
this is the thing which jehovah hath commanded concerning the daughters of <unk> saying let them <unk> whom they <unk> only they shall <unk> one of the tribe of their father
and it came to pass after this that david <unk> of jehovah saying shall i go up into one of the cities of judah and jehovah said to him go up and david said whither shall i go up and he said unto hebron
wherefore having much <unk> in christ to <unk> thee what is <unk>
and <unk> said as jehovah <unk> even what jehovah shall say to me that will i speak
and joab said to the man that told him and behold thou <unk> and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and i would have given thee ten silver pieces and a <unk>
and laid it in his new <unk> which he had <unk> in the rock and having <unk> a great stone to the door of the <unk> went away
and moses seeing it <unk> at the vision and as he went up to <unk> it there was a voice of lord
and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him
and the sons of hebron <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
therefore it is said in the book of the <unk> of jehovah <unk> in <unk> and the <unk> of <unk>
i indeed <unk> you with water to <unk> but he that comes after me is <unk> than i whose <unk> i am not <unk> to bear he shall <unk> you with holy spirit and fire
and ye shall serve jehovah your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and i will take <unk> away from thy midst
suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that it was an <unk> wherefore should god be <unk> at thy voice and destroy the work of thy hands
of him that <unk> upon the heavens the heavens which are of old lo he <unk> his voice a mighty voice
and the king took counsel and made two <unk> of gold and he said to them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy gods israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt
they took up therefore stones that they might cast at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and thus passed on
now all <unk> and the strangers <unk> there <unk> their time in nothing <unk> than to tell and to hear the <unk>
and ye <unk> not <unk> after your enemies and smite the <unk> of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for jehovah your god has given them into your hand
and the priest shall take holy water in an <unk> <unk> and the priest shall take of the dust that is on the <unk> of the tabernacle and put it into the water
thus saith the lord jehovah this is jerusalem i have set her in the midst of the nations and the <unk> are round about her
and delivered up his people unto the sword and was very <unk> with his inheritance
that thou keep the commandment <unk> <unk> until the <unk> of our lord jesus christ
then god came to balaam at night and said to him if the men have come to call thee rise up go with them but only what i shall say unto thee shalt thou do
hear ye that are far off what i have done and ye that are near <unk> my might
since would they not indeed have <unk> being offered on account of the <unk> <unk> <unk> having no <unk> any <unk> of sins
but ye would not go up and <unk> against the word of jehovah your god
and he said to moses go up to jehovah thou and aaron <unk> and <unk> and seventy of the elders of israel and worship afar off
<unk> the son of <unk> had <unk> and <unk> and all <unk> which is by <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> to <unk> as far as beyond <unk>
and he said to the men of <unk> give i pray you <unk> of bread to the people that follow me for they are <unk> and i am <unk> after <unk> and <unk> kings of <unk>
and i gave them a <unk> to <unk> the chief at the place <unk> and i put words in their <unk> to say to <unk> his brethren the <unk> at the place <unk> that they should bring to us <unk> for the house of our god
and knowest the will and <unk> <unk> the things that are more <unk> being <unk> out of the law

for by thee i have run through a <unk> and by my god have i <unk> over a wall
and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me mine enemy and he said i have found because thou hast sold thyself to do evil in the sight of jehovah
and he went away and began to <unk> in the <unk> how great things jesus had done for him and all <unk>

and <unk> went forth out of the king s house and spoke to the king saying
out of his mouth go forth <unk> <unk> of fire <unk> out

and he built an altar there and called upon the name of jehovah and he <unk> his tent there and there isaac s servants <unk> a well
and absalom said <unk> that i were made judge in the land that every man who has any <unk> and cause might come to me and i would do him <unk>
an inheritance <unk> <unk> at the beginning will not be blessed in the end
the fear of jehovah <unk> days but the years of the wicked shall be <unk>
and the sons of reuben israel s <unk> son their generations after their families according to their fathers houses by the number of the names according to their <unk> every male from twenty years old and <unk> all that went forth to <unk> service
shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idols so do to jerusalem and her <unk>

then are <unk> with him two <unk> one on the right hand and one on the left
it is better to dwell in a <unk> of the <unk> than with a <unk> woman and a house in <unk>
when therefore the lord of the <unk> comes what shall he do to those <unk>
blessed is the people that know the <unk> of joy they walk o jehovah in the light of thy <unk>

when he giveth <unk> who then will <unk> and when he <unk> face who shall behold him and this towards a nation or towards a man <unk>
therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts because ye have not <unk> to my words

and all the vessels that king <unk> in his reign cast away in his <unk> have we prepared and hallowed and behold they are before the altar of jehovah
judge me o god and <unk> my cause against an <unk> nation deliver me from the <unk> and <unk> man
but jesus having called them to said ye know that the <unk> of the nations <unk> <unk> over them and the great <unk> authority over them
the <unk> went before the <unk> on <unk> <unk> after in the midst of <unk> <unk> on <unk>
and <unk> the son of manasseh went and took their <unk> and called them <unk>
and when he was at the place he said to them pray that ye enter not into <unk>

and the levites the <unk> all they of <unk> of <unk> of <unk> with their sons and their brethren <unk> in <unk> with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> stood at the east end of the altar and with them a hundred and twenty priests <unk> with <unk>
and it came to pass when the king heard the word of the man of god which he cried against the altar in bethel that jeroboam stretched forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his hand which he stretched out against him <unk> up so that he could not bring it back again to him
and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> the servant the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> heard it and they <unk> us and <unk> us and said what is this thing which ye do will ye <unk> against the king
and he returned to be healed in <unk> because of the <unk> that were given him at <unk> when he fought with <unk> king of syria and <unk> the son of <unk> king of judah went down to see <unk> the son of ahab at <unk> for he was sick
and he made a <unk> for the entrance of the tent of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk>
and cried seeing the <unk> of her burning saying what is like to the great city
and jehovah sent a <unk> upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men
but i <unk> in thee jehovah i said thou art my god
and it came to pass when aaron spoke to the whole assembly of the children of israel that they turned toward the wilderness and behold the glory of jehovah appeared in the cloud
my soul hath long dwelt with them that hate peace
the sons of esau <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
and thou shalt make a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> work shall it be made with <unk>
but he answering said to him that spoke to him who is my mother and who are my brethren
and the <unk> were three <unk> over <unk> and thirty in order and they entered into the wall which the house had for the <unk> round about that they might have hold but they had not hold in the wall of the house
and from the time that <unk> turned aside from <unk> jehovah they made a <unk> against him in jerusalem and he fled to <unk> and they sent after him to <unk> and slew him there
and he poured of the <unk> oil on aaron s head and anointed him to hallow him
how long shall i bear with this evil assembly which <unk> against me i have heard the <unk> of the children of israel which they <unk> against me
do unto them as to <unk> as to <unk> as to <unk> at the <unk> of <unk>
and the men were <unk> with great <unk> and <unk> the name of god who had authority over these <unk> and did not <unk> to give him glory
and the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning on it it shall not be put out and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning and lay the burntoffering in order upon it and he shall burn <unk> the fat of the <unk>
their heart is as fat as <unk> as for me i delight in thy law
and it came to pass as we were going to prayer that a certain <unk> <unk> having a spirit of <unk> <unk> us who brought much <unk> to her <unk> by <unk>
for ye have the poor <unk> with you but me ye have not <unk>
and <unk> went up from <unk> and all israel with him and they <unk> <unk>
but on the <unk> day of the seventh month when ye have gathered in the <unk> of the land ye shall <unk> the feast of jehovah seven days on the first day there shall be rest and on the <unk> day there shall be rest
and of <unk> a thousand captains and with them <unk> thousand with <unk> and <unk>
and his servants told david these words and the thing was right in david s sight to be the king s <unk> and the days were not <unk>
and the border turned from <unk> <unk> toward mount <unk> and passed toward the side of <unk> that is <unk> <unk> and went down to <unk> and passed <unk>
and they shall <unk> your <unk> upon you and ye shall bear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that i the lord jehovah
and jeroboam the son of <unk> an <unk> of <unk> solomon s servant whose mother s name was <unk> a <unk> woman even he lifted up his hand against the king
which doth not hearken to the voice of <unk> of one <unk> ever so <unk>
but they being come to jesus <unk> him <unk> saying he is <unk> to whom thou shouldest <unk> this
who is left among you that saw this house in its <unk> glory and how do ye see it now is it not as nothing in your eyes
but if a man <unk> <unk> toward his neighbour and slay him with <unk> thou shalt take him from mine altar that he may die
neither can they make good the things of which they now <unk> me
for a young man <unk> a <unk> shall thy sons <unk> thee and with the joy of the <unk> over the <unk> shall thy god rejoice over thee
and he gave them the <unk> of the nations and they took possession of the labour of the peoples
and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the <unk> <unk> it was to the <unk> of the house and he called to the man clothed with <unk> who had the <unk> s <unk> by his side
who gave himself for our sins so that he should deliver us out of the present evil world according to the will of our god and father
every man <unk> or <unk> having on his head <unk> his head to shame
and my tabernacle shall be over them and i will be their god and they shall be my people
of the nations of which jehovah had said to the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in to you they would certainly turn away your heart after their gods to these solomon was <unk> in love
in the <unk> of god brought he me into the land of israel and set me upon a very high mountain and upon it was as the <unk> of a city on the south
wherefore she went forth out of the place where she had been and her two <unk> with her and they went on the way to return to the land of judah
and david came to <unk> and <unk> looked and saw david and went out of the <unk> and bowed himself to david with face to the ground
and every tongue <unk> that jesus christ lord to god father s glory
for they had not yet known the <unk> that he must rise from among dead
and the people <unk> them for benjamin because jehovah had made a <unk> in the tribes of israel
and they brought little children to him that he might <unk> them but the disciples <unk> those that brought
and he said to her give me thy son and he took him out of her <unk> and carried him up into the <unk> <unk> where he <unk> and laid him upon his own bed
because the mind of the flesh is <unk> against god for it is not <unk> to the law of god for neither indeed can it be
or as a <unk> <unk> <unk> i had not been as <unk> that have not seen the light
and moses was <unk> in all wisdom of the egyptians and he was mighty in his words and <unk>
but <unk> i <unk> not thine own but that of the other for why is my <unk> judged by another <unk>
but they that <unk> paul brought him as far as <unk> and having received a commandment to <unk> and <unk> that they should come to him as <unk> as <unk> they departed
turn again to the <unk> <unk> of hope even today do i declare i will <unk> <unk> unto thee
and thou shalt put the two <unk> of gold in the two <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>
and behold the <unk> came and the <unk> said let my lord the king receive good tidings for jehovah has <unk> thee this day of all them that rose up against thee
but the <unk> <unk> that were before me had been <unk> to the people and had taken of them bread and wine besides forty <unk> of silver even their servants bore rule over the people but i did not so because of the fear of god
and i said what is it and he said this is the <unk> that goeth forth and he said this is their <unk> in all the land
for jesus himself bore witness that a prophet has no honour in his own country
<unk> his son <unk> his son <unk> his son
thou shalt fall on the open field for i have spoken saith the lord jehovah
which jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of judah and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem saying
therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts behold i <unk> them the young men shall die by the sword their sons and their daughters shall die by famine
for god is my witness how i long after you all in <unk> of christ jesus
teach me good <unk> and knowledge for i have believed in thy commandments

therefore are my <unk> filled with <unk> <unk> hath taken hold upon me as the <unk> of a woman in <unk> i am bowed down so as not to hear i am <unk> so as not to see
now samuel was dead and all israel had <unk> him and they had buried him in <unk> even in his own city and saul had put away the <unk> and the <unk> out of the land
and the chief fathers of judah and benjamin rose up and the priests and the levites even all those whose spirit god had <unk> to go up to build the house of jehovah which is at jerusalem
every one that is <unk> against thy commandment and <unk> not to thy words in everything that thou <unk> us shall be put to death only be strong and <unk>
gather to me all the elders of your tribes and your <unk> that i may speak these words in their ears and take heaven and earth to witness against them
but a tenth part shall still be therein and it shall return and be eaten as the <unk> and as the <unk> whose <unk> after the <unk> the holy seed shall be the <unk> thereof
and he said to him fear not for the hand of saul my father will not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall be <unk> to thee and that also saul my father <unk>
and it came to pass as he was <unk> alone his disciples were with him and he asked them saying who do the crowds say that i am
hear another <unk> there was a <unk> who <unk> a <unk> and made a <unk> round it and <unk> a <unk> in it and built a <unk> and let it out to <unk> and left the country
and her gates shall <unk> and <unk> and <unk> she shall sit upon the ground
for some <unk> because <unk> had the <unk> that jesus was saying to him <unk> the things of which we have need for the feast or that he should give <unk> to the poor
and the sons of <unk> were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> silver shall they call them for jehovah hath <unk> them
and thou pray not for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them for i will not hear in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble
he <unk> wickedness up on his bed he <unk> himself in a way that is not good he <unk> not evil
and they cried with a <unk> voice saying how long o <unk> <unk> holy and true dost thou not judge and <unk> our blood on them that dwell upon the earth
he goeth forth and <unk> <unk> seed for <unk> he cometh again with <unk> <unk> his <unk>
the children of <unk> six hundred and <unk>
i i have spoken yea i have called him i have brought him and his way shall be <unk>
and they were <unk> at his <unk> for he <unk> them as having authority and not as the scribes
and david was then in the <unk> and the philistines <unk> was then at <unk>
and he said i can not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place
and in the <unk> he sent to the <unk> a bondman that they might give to him of the fruit of the <unk> but the <unk> having <unk> him sent away <unk>

of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
the yoke of my <unk> is bound by his hand they are <unk> they are come up upon my neck he hath made my strength to <unk> the lord hath delivered me into hands out of which i am not able to rise up
in that day shall messengers go forth from me in <unk> to make <unk> <unk> afraid and <unk> shall come upon them as in the day of egypt for behold it cometh
thou hast <unk> my holy things and hast <unk> my <unk>
and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do <unk>
for thus saith jehovah of hosts after the glory hath he sent me unto the nations that made you a spoil for he that <unk> you <unk> the <unk> of his eye
on the <unk> he would go forth into galilee and jesus <unk> <unk> and says to him follow me
one cup of ten of gold full of incense
for the ways of man are before the eyes of jehovah and he <unk> all his <unk>
but jehovah said to samuel look not on his <unk> or on the <unk> of his <unk> because i have <unk> him for it is not as man <unk> for man <unk> upon the <unk> <unk> but jehovah <unk> upon the heart
this is of lord and it is <unk> in our eyes
<unk> <unk> i pray thee hear mine <unk> and hearken to all my words
and the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of israel and the whole congregation of israel stood
at that time jehovah said unto me <unk> for thyself two <unk> of stone like the first and come up unto me into the mountain and make thee an ark of wood
and there was war again and david went forth and fought with the philistines and smote them with a great slaughter and they fled before him
and it came to pass afterwards he went into a city called <unk> and many of his disciples and a great crowd went with him
and the anger of jehovah was <unk> against israel and he sold them into the hand of <unk> king of <unk> and the children of israel served <unk> <unk> years
and because they were of the same <unk> <unk> with them and wrought for they were <unk> by <unk>
and i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there stood before the river a ram which had two horns and the two horns were high and one was <unk> than the other and the <unk> came up last
thou mayest not eat within thy gates the <unk> of thy corn or of thy new wine or of thine oil or the <unk> of thy <unk> or of thy sheep nor any of thy <unk> which thou <unk> nor thy <unk> nor the heaveoffering of thy hand
and he said to him take me a <unk> of three years old and a <unk> of three years old and a ram of three years old and a <unk> and a young <unk>
so the king hearkened not to the people for it was brought about by jehovah that he might give <unk> to his word which jehovah spoke through <unk> the <unk> to jeroboam the son of <unk>
and he arose and ate and <unk> and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty <unk> to <unk> the mount of god
and as they went behold some of the <unk> went into the city and brought word to the chief priests of all that had taken place
but i <unk> to you <unk> our sister who is <unk> of the assembly which is in <unk>
until we all <unk> at the <unk> of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god at <unk> man at measure of the <unk> of the <unk> of the christ
by thine ordinances they stand this day for all things are thy servants
behold how good and how <unk> it is for brethren to dwell together in <unk>
and the word of jehovah came unto me the second time saying
immediately therefore those who were going to <unk> him left him and the <unk> also was afraid when he <unk> that he was a <unk> and because he had bound him
and i will give to my two <unk> and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred <unk> days clothed in <unk>
the god who hath <unk> me and hath <unk> the peoples to me
and saul said to him whose son art thou young man and david said i am the son of thy servant <unk> the <unk>

three <unk> <unk> like <unk> in the one <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> and three <unk> <unk> like <unk> in the other <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> so in the six <unk> that come out of the <unk>
then he <unk> men s ears and <unk> their <unk>
is not this in which my lord <unk> and in which indeed he <unk> ye have done evil what ye have done
and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me and i will offer in his tent sacrifices of <unk> of joy i will sing yea i will sing <unk> unto jehovah
<unk> i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth and i will <unk> unto thee an everlasting covenant
the families of the sons of <unk> encamped on the side of the tabernacle <unk>
but <unk> the son of <unk> <unk> from <unk> with <unk> men and went to the children of ammon
and my <unk> shall <unk> when thy lips speak right things
and the <unk> that he made was <unk> as <unk> in the hand of the <unk> and he made it again another <unk> as <unk> good to the <unk> to make
and isaac dwelt at <unk>
and if he be found he shall <unk> <unk> he shall give all the <unk> of his house
all that the father <unk> me shall come to me and him that comes to me i will not at all cast out
and the anger of jehovah was <unk> against israel and he delivered them into the hands of <unk> that <unk> them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about and they could not any <unk> stand before their enemies
and jehovah was with jehoshaphat for he walked in the first ways of his father david and sought not unto the <unk>
jehovah said unto my lord sit at my right hand until i put thine enemies <unk> of thy feet
know that jehovah is god it is he that hath made us and not we <unk> we are his people and the sheep of his <unk>
only the people are strong that dwell in the land and the cities are <unk> very great <unk> we saw the children of <unk> there
then pharaoh <unk> all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river but every daughter ye shall save alive
now a <unk> of the things of which we are speaking we have such a one high priest who has sat down on right hand of the throne of the <unk> in the heavens
and moses went up to god and jehovah called to him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel
and he was an <unk> to israel all the days of solomon besides the <unk> that <unk> and he <unk> israel and reigned over syria
and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy bondman and thy <unk> and the <unk> and the stranger and the <unk> and the <unk> that are in thy gates
be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his <unk> but suffer evil <unk> with the glad tidings according to the power of god
evil <unk> <unk> but to the righteous good shall be <unk>
jehovah hath <unk> his fury he hath poured out his <unk> anger and hath <unk> a fire in zion which hath consumed the <unk> thereof
then said saul to his servants seek me a woman that has a spirit of <unk> that i may go to her and <unk> of her and his servants said to him behold there is a woman who has a spirit of <unk> at <unk>
