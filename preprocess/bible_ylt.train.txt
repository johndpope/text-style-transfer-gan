and <unk> answereth joshua and saith <unk> i have sinned against jehovah god of israel and thus and thus i have done
and he <unk> them before the king of moab and they dwell with him all the days of david s being in the <unk>
then <unk> with him are two <unk> one on the right hand and one on the left
better to sit on a <unk> of the <unk> than a woman of <unk> and a house of company

and evening having come he was <unk> at <unk> with the twelve
every day also in the temple and in every house they were not <unk> teaching and <unk> good news jesus the christ
for they being not yet born neither having done anything good or evil that the <unk> of god according to <unk> might remain not of works but of him who is calling it was said to her
who doth declare to his face his way and that which he hath done who doth give <unk> to him
every <unk> after its kind
